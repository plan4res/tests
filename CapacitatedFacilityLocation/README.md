# test/CapacitatedFacilityLocationBlock

A tester which provides initial tests for `CapacitatedFacilityLocationBlock`,
possibly `MCFBlock` and `MCFSolver`, possibly `BinaryKnapsackBlock` and any
specialised `Solver` for it, possibly `LagrangianDualSolver`, `LagBFunction`,
any `CDASolver` able to handle `C05Function` in the `Objective` (such as
`BundleSolver`), any `Solver` able to handle (Mixed Integer) Linear Programs
(such as `MILPSolver` and its derived classes `CPXMILPSolver` ,
`SCIPMILPSolver` and `GRBMILPSolver`), as well as for quite a lot of the 
mechanics of the "core" SMS++ library.

This executable, given the filename and (optionally) filetype of one
Capacitated Facility Location (CFL) instance in one of the several supported
file formats, reads the instance in a `CapacitatedFacilityLocationBlock`. It
then creates another `Block` via the R3Block mechanism, as configured by the
file R3BCfg.txt; this can then be either another
`CapacitatedFacilityLocationBlock` or a `MCFBlock` representing the continuous
relaxation of CFL (as a Min-Cost Flow problem). The two `Block` are
`BlockConfig`-ured by the files BPar1.txt and BPar2.txt, respectively, and a
`Solver` is attached to each by the `BlockSolverConfig` read from the files
BSPar1.txt and BSPar2.txt, respectively. Also, an `UpdateSolver` is manually
registered to the first `CapacitatedFacilityLocationBlock` so that any
change on it is automatically map\_forward-ed to the other `Block` (but not
vice-versa).

According to the value of the `niter` parameter, this is all: the `Solver`
are supposed to be exact (but it may well be that they are both exactly
solving the continuous relaxation, and the optimal values are compared.

Otherwise, the `Solver` attached to the R3Block is supposed to be solving
some kind of continuous relaxation and a certain number of rounds of a
simple slope scaling heuristic are ran on that `Block`: the continuous
solution is map\_back-ed to the original `CapacitatedFacilityLocationBlock`,
it is used to temporarily change the facility costs according to the standard
slope scaling idea, and then it is rounded up to obtain a feasible solution
(in this case expecting that the `CapacitatedFacilityLocationBlock` is in the
"splittable" version where continuous X[ i ][ j ] variables are feasible).
This is repeated for a maximum number of iterations, or until the solution
(value) of the relaxation stops changing. In this case the results (both
lower and upper bound) are compared with the optimal value of the other
`Solver`, but not expecting them to be equal. Note that there are at least
three significantly different implementations for the R3Block and its
`Solver`:

* The R3Block is a `CapacitatedFacilityLocationBlock` (in any formulation)
  and the `Solver` is, say, a `:MILPSolver` solving its continuous relaxation
  by standard LP tools, possibly with the dynamic generation of the strong
  forcing constraints to improve the bound.

* The R3Block is a `MCFBlock` solved by a `MCFSolver`: a much weaker bound,
  and the much worse/more fractional solution that comes with it, but
  obtained (possibly, much) faster.

* The R3Block is a `CapacitatedFacilityLocationBlock` in the KF and the
  `Solver` is a `LagrangianDualSolver`, say using `BundleSolver` to drive
  the solution of the Lagrangian Dual and `DPBinaryKnapsackSolver` to solve
  the Lagrangian subproblems: a much stronger bound, and the much better/less
  fractional solution that comes with it, but obtained at a (much) higher
  computational cost.

This anyway shows how these three completely different arrangements can be
obtained with exactly the same executable by just changing the configuration
files. In fact, the three folders [cuts](cuts), [MCF](MCF) and [LD](LD)
contain configuration files primed for these three different settings, plus
a symlink to the same executable.

All this is possibly repeated a number of times in a loop where data of the
CFLproblem (fixed and transportation costs, demands, capacities, facilities
being open, closed or fixed-open, and the problem being splittable or not)
are modified at random. Note that:

* changing the problem type will not go well with the slope scaling heuristic,
  since that only works with the splittable version of the problem;

* the MCF R3Block has an unavoidable issue with negative facility costs,
  that should therefore be avoided if one wants to be sure that the optimal
  values of the continuous relaxation coincide (see `NEGATIVE\_F\_COSTS` in
  [test.cpp](test.cpp));

* Many `MCFSolver` are based on the algorithms of the rather old
  [MCFClass project](https://github.com/frangio68/Min-Cost-Flow-Class), that
  have a questionable habit of requiring well-scaled absolute numerical
  tolerances to work; this may be necessary, again, when testing the
  `MCFBlock` R3Block (see `SET\_EPS` in [test.cpp](test.cpp), and please
  don't complain that this is not `Solver`-independent as it should be: it's
  the `MCFClass` solvers that are not properly implemented).

The usage of the executable is the following:

      ./CFL_test name [typ niter seed wchg #rounds #chng %chng]
      typ = [C], F, L, ignored if name ends in .nc4
      niter: how many Slope Scaling iterations [0]
      wchg: what to change, coded bit-wise 
            0 = facility cost, 1 = transportation cost
            2 = capacities, 3 = demands
            4 = close, 5 = re-open, 6 = fix-open fac.
            7 = change problem type (split/unsplit)
            8 (+256) = change abstract representation
      #rounds: number of changing rounds [40]
      #chng: average number of elements to change [10]
      %chng: probability of any single change [0.5]

A [batch](batch) file is provided that runs the test on a largish set of CFL
instances, supposed to be in the `data/` folder, the idea being it is a
symlink (or copy) of that of the
[CapacitatedFacilityLocationBlock
repo](https://gitlab.com/smspp/capacitatedfacilitylocationblock);
but not all of them and not the very large ones, so that the tests does end
in reasonable time if the continuous relaxations are solved. A smaller
[batch-s](batch-s) file is provided that only solves the one that are small
and easy enough so that the test can be ran while solving the instances to
integer optimality (required if, for instance, you want to test changing
the problem type from splittable to unsplittable).

A makefile is also provided that builds the executable including the
`LagrangianDualSolver` module, the `BundleSolver` module, the `MILPSolver`
module, the `MCFBlock` module, the `BinaryKnapsackBlock` module, together of
course with the core SMS++ library.

All the tests passing give some confidence that no regressions have been
done for the involved `Block` (`CapacitatedFacilityLocationBlock`,
`MCFBlock`, and `BinaryKnapsackBlock`) and the `Solver` used in the
solution process.
