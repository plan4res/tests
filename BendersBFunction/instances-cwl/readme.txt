These are basically the Capacitated warehouse location ORLib instances from

http://people.brunel.ac.uk/~mastjjb/jeb/orlib/capinfo.html

read manual.txt for details. A few exceptions:

- one "small" instance (basically, cap41.txt "divided by five")

- the three large intances capa, capb and capc in the original
  distributions were "meta", with one parameter to be taken
  from a paper (see manual.txt) among four possible values:
  these have been properly instantiated in
  capa1.txt ... capa4.txt, ..., capc1.txt ... capc4.txt
