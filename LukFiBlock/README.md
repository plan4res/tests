# test/LukFiBlock

A very simple main for running tests with
[LukFiBlock](https://gitlab.com/smspp/lukfiblock). It just creates one and
loads it from a stream; little more than a compilation check.

A makefile is also provided that builds the executable including the
`BundleSolver` module and all its dependencies, in particular
`MILPSolver` (and, obviously, the core SMS++ library).
